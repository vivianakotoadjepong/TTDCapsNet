   ## Introduction
We introduced a three hierachically layerd Capsule Network (CapsNet) structure named Tri Texton-Dense CapsNet (TTDCapsNet) with the aim of 
improving the classification of complex and medical images. The Texton layer contributes significantly to the better performance of the model.
Results from this study suggest that TTDCapsNet surpasses the baseline and demonstrates competitive performance when compared to state-of-the-art
CapsNet models
